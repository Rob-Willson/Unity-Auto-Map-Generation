# Unity-Auto-Map-Generation
 Prototype 2D map auto-generation in Unity based on colors in an image.
 
 To test:
 1. Download
 2. Open & Play in Unity
 3. Use WASD/arrow keys to move camera around
 4. Observe that map generation is randomised based on colors in a template image (/Assets/Map/TerrainMap_0.png), with pixel colors determining different terrains/biomes
